                    <h2>Macarons</h2>
                    <p>
                        Macarons are one of the most versatile desserts that can be made in various flavors for any
                        season.
                        These raspberry macarons made with white chocolate and raspberry filling are one of the most
                        flavorful macarons ever, the sweetness of the shells is very well balanced by the tart
                        raspberries used not only in the filling but also in macaron shells. When making raspberry or
                        strawberry macarons I like to use freeze dried fruit powder along the fresh fruits so their
                        flavor is enhanced without changing their texture.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How to prepare it?</h3>
                    <h4>1) Prepare white chocolate raspberry filling</h4>
                    <p>
                        Place raspberries and sugar into a small saucepan and bring to a boil while stirring constantly.
                        Simmer for about 5 minutes or until thickens and remove from heat. Sieve to remove the seeds.
                        Set aside.Place the sieved raspberry jam, cream and chocolate in a small saucepan. Place over
                        low heat to melt the chocolate. Add freeze dried raspberries and red food coloring if used.
                        Transfer to a small bowl, let cool completely and refrigerate before using.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2) Prepare the macaron shells</h4>
                    <p>
                        Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and have a pastry bag with a plain tip (about Â½
                        inch, 1 cm) ready. Preheat oven to 300F (150C).Grind together the powdered sugar with almond
                        powder and freeze-dried raspberries, using a food processor, to obtain a fine powder. Sift
                        through a sieve into large bowl.In a small bowl place 55g egg whites and a pinch of red food
                        coloring. Beat together until well combined. Pour the whites over the sieved almonds.Place the
                        other 55g egg whites and salt into a mixing bowl. Set aside until you prepare the sugar syrup.In
                        a small saucepan combine granulated sugar with water and place on medium heat. Using a candy
                        thermometer measure syrup temperature. When it reaches 230 F (112C) start whipping the egg
                        whites. When the syrup reaches 244F (118C) pour it over the whipped egg whites while mixing
                        continuously. Continue beating until the bowl has cooled slightly, and glossy stiff peaks have
                        formed.Add the whipped whites over the almonds mixture and using a rubber or silicone spatula
                        gently fold in until combined and smooth. Work the batter until it flows in very thick ribbons
                        when the spatula is lifted.Transfer the mixture to the piping bag fitted with a 1/2 inch (1 cm)
                        plain tip.Pipe the batter on the parchment-lined baking sheets in 1-inch (2.5 cm) circles,
                        evenly spaced one-inch (2 cm) apart.Rap the baking sheet a few times firmly on the counter top
                        to flatten the macarons and to remove air bubbles.Bake for 20-24 minutes. Let cool slightly
                        before removing from baking sheet.Place the raspberry and white chocolate filling into a piping
                        bag and spread on the inside of the macarons and sandwich them together.Refrigerate for at at
                        least one day before serving, to meld the flavors. Serve macarons at room temperature.
                    </p>

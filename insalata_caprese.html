            <h1>Insalata Caprese</h1>
            <p>
                Insalata Caprese (known in the States as a Caprese Salad) is a traditional Italian appetizer. 
                Juicy tomatoes, fresh basil, and soft mozzarella cheese make this salad a summer favorite.
                Insalata Caprese, as you’ll find this salad called in Italy, has its origins from the island of Capri, south of the coast of Naples.
                The name, in fact, literally translates to “salad of Capri”.
                The first “Salads of Capri” were probably created to use a soft local cheese, rather than the mozzarella that is commonly used today. 
                The traditional Italian way of eating insalata caprese is as an antipasto, or starter, to your meal.
                With garden basil, juicy tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, this salad is bursting with flavor and texture. All you need is a drizzle of good quality extra virgin olive oil to bring this salad together and make the creamy flavors of the mozzarella really stand out.
                If you need to store it, it will stay good in an air tight container for 2-3 days.
                But, if you do need to prepare it ahead of time, we would recommend slicing all the ingredients and keeping them separate in the refrigerator. Then you can plate it just before serving.

            <h2>How to prepare it?</h2>
            <p>
                Slice the tomatoes and cheese into .5cm thick slices. Arrange the salad on a serving platter or individual plates in an alternating pattern, with two to three slices of tomato for every piece of cheese. Season with the salt and pepper to taste. Scatter the basil leaves over the top and drizzle with the oil. Serve at room temperature.
